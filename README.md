# VulnerableMachine-PentestReports

This repository contains a collection of reports detailing my experience working on various vulnerable machines hosted on Vulnhub and HacktheBox.


Introduction

As a Penetration Tester, I have been working on various vulnerable machines hosted on Vulnhub and HacktheBox to hone my penetration testing skills. This repository contains detailed reports of my experience working on these machines, including the steps I took to identify vulnerabilities, exploit them, and gain access to the target system.


Background
Vulnhub and HacktheBox are two popular platforms for practicing penetration testing and hacking skills. The machines hosted on these platforms simulate real-world vulnerabilities, and provide an opportunity for practitioners to hone their skills in a safe and controlled environment.

The purpose of this repository is to document my own experiences working on these vulnerable machines, and to provide a resource for others who are interested in learning more about penetration testing and ethical hacking.

Usage

The reports are organized by the name of the vulnerable machine and are saved in PDF format for easy viewing. Each report includes a brief introduction to the machine, the methodology I used to attack the machine, the tools and techniques I employed, and a summary of my findings including screenshots and other evidence of successful exploitation.


Contributing
